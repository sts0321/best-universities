    \tMassachusetts Institute of Technology, the East Coast mecca of engineering, science, and mathematics, “is the ultimate place for information overload, endless possibilities, and expanding your horizons.” The “amazing collection of creative minds” includes enough Nobel laureates to fill a jury box as well as brilliant students who are given substantial control of their educations; one explains, “The administration’s attitude toward students is one of respect. As soon as you come on campus, you are bombarded with choices.” Students need to be able to manage a workload that “definitely push[es you] beyond your comfort level.” A chemical engineering major elaborates: “MIT is different from many schools in that its goal is not to teach you specific facts in each subject. MIT teaches you how to think, not about opinions but about problem solving. Facts and memorization are useless unless you know how to approach a tough problem.” Professors here range from “excellent teachers who make lectures fun and exciting” to “dull and soporific” ones, but most “make a serious effort to make the material they teach interesting by throwing in jokes and cool demonstrations.” “Access to an amazing number of resources, both academic and recreational,” “research opportunities for undergrads with some of the nation’s leading professors,” and a rock-solid alumni network complete the picture. If you ask “MIT alumni where they went to college, most will immediately stick out their hand and show you their ‘brass rat’ (the MIT ring, the second most recognized ring in the world).”\n\n
    Student Body:\n
    \t“There actually isn’t one typical student at MIT,” students here assure us, explaining that “hobbies range from building robots and hacking to getting wasted and partying every weekend. The one thing students all have in common is that they are insanely smart and love to learn. Pretty much anyone can find the perfect group of friends to hang out with at MIT.” “Most students do have some form of ‘nerdiness’” (like telling nerdy jokes, being an avid fan of Star Wars, etc.), but “contrary to MIT’s stereotype, most MIT students are not geeks who study all the time and have no social skills. The majority of the students here are actually quite ‘normal.’” The “stereotypical student [who] looks techy and unkempt…only represents about 25 percent of the school.” The rest include “multiple-sport standouts, political activists, fraternity and sorority members, hippies, clean-cut business types, LARPers, hackers, musicians, and artisans. There are people who look like they stepped out of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog and people who dress in all black and carry flashlights and multi-tools. Not everyone relates to everyone else, but most people get along, and it’s almost a guarantee that you’ll fit in somewhere.\n\n
    Campus Life:\n

    \tAt MIT, “it may seem…like there’s no life outside problem sets and studying for exams,” but “there’s always time for extracurricular activities or just relaxing” for those “with good time management skills” or the “ability to survive on [a] lack of sleep.” Options range from “building rides” (recent projects have included a motorized couch and a human-sized hamster wheel) “to partying at fraternities to enjoying the largest collection of science fiction novels in the United States at the MIT Science Fiction Library.” Students occasionally find time to “pull a hack,” which is a prank, “like the life-size Wright brothers’ plane that appeared on top of the Great Dome for the one-hundredth anniversary of flight.” Undergrads tell us, “MIT has great parties—a lot of Wellesley, Harvard, and BU students come to them,” but also that “there are tons of things to do other than party” here. “Movies, shopping, museums, and plays are all possible with our location near Boston. There are great restaurants only [blocks] away from campus too.... From what I can tell, MIT students have way more fun on the weekends than their Cambridge counterparts [at] Harvard.”

    The University of Cambridge\n
    \tThe University of Cambridge is a public collegiate research university in Cambridge, England. Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world\'s third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university\'s founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople. The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge.\n\n
    In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter, granted by King Henry III. The University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. The largest department is Cambridge University Press & Assessment, which has £1 billion of annual revenue and reaches 100 million learners. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.\n\n
    The university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge\'s 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world\'s largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes. Among the university\'s notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, John Harvard, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Sylvia Plath, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and others.\n\n

    The University of Oxford\n
    \tThe University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world\'s second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as Oxbridge.\n\n
    The University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions. Each college is a self-governing institution within the university, controlling its own membership and having its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. Traditionally, each of Oxford\'s constituent colleges is associated with another of the colleges in the University of Cambridge, with the only exceptional addition of Trinity College, Dublin. It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n
    Oxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world\'s oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2023, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.92 billion, of which £789 million was from research grants and contracts.\n\n
    Oxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals. Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n

    Harvard University\n
    \tHarvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.\n\n
    Harvard\'s founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, "dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches". Though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite. Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot\'s long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities. James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n
    The university is composed of ten academic faculties and the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses: the 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston\'s Longwood Medical Area. Harvard\'s endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world. Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans. According to the American Library Association, Harvard University has the fourth-largest library by volumes held in the United States.\n\n
    Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, founders of notable companies, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients, Pulitzer Prize winners, and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories. Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards and 110 Olympic medals (46 gold).\n\n

    Academics:\n
    \tThere are few universities that can match the prestige and caliber of Stanford University. At “the forefront of [nearly] every field of study,” it’s easy to understand why so many students are attracted to the school. Of course, far more than simply offering access to highly rated departments, Stanford strives to “expand your creativity, challenge and deepen your world view, and make you a passionate and informed citizen of the world.” Moreover, the opportunities for research “are incredible” and “the support for students (residential, emotional, academic) is unrivaled.” And while the university is certainly “academically rigorous,” it is “without the competitive edge that many top-tier institutions are known for.” Inside the classroom, undergrads are privy to “dynamic” professors who easily “draw [students] into the material because they are so excited to share their passion for the subject.” Though instructors are “at the top of their respective fields,” most are also “engaging and approachable.” A mechanical engineering major supports this sentiment sharing, “I play basketball on Friday mornings with my major adviser and will often bring my homework with me in order to talk to him about problems I’m stuck on afterward.” Ultimately, as this senior boasts, “At Stanford, anything is possible; I’ve lived on a schooner with faculty studying sharks, snorkeled on the Great Barrier Reef, hiked in the Australian rainforest, studied Antarctic phytoplankton with world-class scientists, and spent countless nights discussing philosophy, politics, film, and art until sunrise.”\n\n
    Student Body:\n
    \tStanford undergrads speak glowingly of their peers: “Everyone here is smart and has some story that will blow you out of the water if you ask, but are very humble and really just looking to have a good time.” They also steadfastly assert, “There really is no typical Stanford student.” And, thankfully, that “makes it easy to be an integrated and diverse student body.” That being said, most Stanford undergrads are “very driven, independently motivated and willing to seek out opportunities.” One senior elaborates by sharing, “Everyone fits in because we’re united by a fire that drives us all to be excited about what we do. The trends you’ll see will be along the lines of leadership and crazy intellect.” Ultimately, students at Stanford are “ridiculously friendly and you can meet new people all over campus at almost every type of event.”\n\n
    Campus Life:\n
    \tUndergrads agree that “it’s pretty much impossible to be bored” at Stanford. Though students “work insanely hard during the week,” they “also make it a priority to have a great time.” And with so much to take advantage of, having fun is pretty easy. For example, the university sponsors “Cardinal Nights,” a non-alcoholic program that hosts a number of events including “trips to Great America, a local amusement park, [a] movie pre-screening, and Stanford’s Got Talent. All of the events are either free or extremely cheap for students.” Undergrads also look forward to “special dinners…a common event in upper class housing.” These are “nice on-campus dinners that are catered by house chefs. The meals usually have themes, such as Saturday Night Live or Moulin Rouge.” Moreover, while there is certainly a drinking scene, it’s pretty laid back. A sophomore explains, “you can find as much or as little of a party culture here as you’re looking for. There’s always a frat party to attend on the weekends, and there’s always people to just hang out with at the dorm.” Finally, students love the fact that hometown Palo Alto leaves them in close proximity to San Francisco. “A trip to the city is a short train-ride or car-ride away, so going to concerts and events in the city is always a fun option. Same goes for the nearby beaches.” However, “there’s always so much going on on-campus that sometimes it’s hard to leave!”\n\n

    History:\n
    \tImperial College London (commonly Imperial or legally Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine) is a public research university in London, England. Its history began with Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, who developed his vision for a cultural area that included the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum and several royal colleges. In 1907, Imperial College London was established by royal charter unifying the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City and Guilds of London Institute. In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St Mary\'s Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.\n\n
    Focus:\n
    \tImperial College London focuses on science, engineering, medicine and business, with an entrepreneurial culture. The main campus is in South Kensington where most teaching and research takes place. A second campus in White City provides a platform for innovation. Facilities also include teaching hospitals throughout London that form an academic health science centre. The college was previously a member of the University of London and became an independent university in 2007. Imperial has a more international community, with around 60% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.\n\n
    19th century:\n
    \tThe earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament. This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines. The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary\'s Hospital in 1851. In 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria. An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington. Within the next six years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry, and in 1881 the opening of the Royal School of Mines and Natural History Museum.\n\n
